Best-case   : The first two numbers in the array add up to 10, so there'd be only two comparisons - O(1)
Average-case: There are two numbers in the array that add up to 10, but they're not very close to each other and are near the middle of the array- O(N)
Worst-case  : There are no two numbers in the array that add up to 10, so we'd have to iterate through the entire array N times - O(N^2)
